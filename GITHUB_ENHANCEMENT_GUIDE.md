# 🚀 Studio CRM - GitHub Enhancement Guide

## ☕ Ko-fi Donation Button - DONE! ✅

**Good News:** Adding donation buttons is **100% allowed** and **encouraged** by GitHub!

### What I Did

- ✅ Created `.github/FUNDING.yml` with your Ko-fi username: `poliinternational`
- ✅ This will show a **"❤️ Sponsor"** button on your repository
- ✅ **No conflict** with MIT License - donations are voluntary, code remains free

### How It Looks

Once you push this file, visitors will see:

```
[❤️ Sponsor] button → Links to: https://ko-fi.com/poliinternational
```

**License Compatibility:** ✅ 100% Compatible

- MIT License = Code is free to use
- Ko-fi button = Optional support (like a tip jar)
- This is the **standard practice** for open-source projects!
