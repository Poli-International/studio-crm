<p>Hi {{CLIENT_NAME}},</p>

<p>It's been 3 days since your session. Your tattoo should be settling down now.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Redness should be gone.</li>
    <li>It may start to feel tight or dry.</li>
    <li>Start using fragrance-free lotion sparingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure it's healing perfectly, please snap a quick photo and upload it below. Our artists review these to catch
    any issues early.</p>
