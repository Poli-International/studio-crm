<p>Congrats on your new piercing! Here is how to take care of it so it heals beautifully.</p>

<p><strong>Aftercare Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Clean 2 times daily with sterile saline solution (NeilMed).</li>
    <li>Do NOT touch it with unwashed hands.</li>
    <li>Do NOT twist or turn the jewelry.</li>
    <li>Avoid sleeping on it.</li>
    <li>No swimming for 2 weeks.</li>

<p>We'll check in soon to make sure swelling is going down.</p>
