<p>Hi {{CLIENT_NAME}},</p>

<p>It's been two weeks since you got your piercing! Time for a quick check-in on your healing progress.</p>

<p><strong>2-Week Healing Check:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the swelling going down?</li>
    <li>Are you still experiencing any pain or discomfort?</li>
    <li>Is there any discharge (clear/white is normal, yellow/green is not)?</li>
    <li>Have you been able to clean it twice daily?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aftercare Reminders:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Continue cleaning with sterile saline solution 2x daily</li>
    <li>Don't touch, twist, or remove your jewelry</li>
    <li>Avoid sleeping on the pierced side if possible</li>
    <li>Keep hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes away from the piercing</li>
    <li>No swimming pools, hot tubs, or lakes for another 2-4 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="alert">Contact Us If You Notice:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Increased redness, heat, or swelling</li>
    <li>Yellow or green discharge with a bad odor</li>
    <li>Jewelry feels too tight or is sinking into the skin</li>
    <li>Bumps forming around the piercing</li>
    <li>Severe pain that's getting worse</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Need a Jewelry Change or Downsizing?</strong></p>
<p>Some piercings benefit from having the jewelry downsized after initial swelling goes down (usually around 4-6 weeks).
    If you think you're ready, or if something doesn't feel right, stop by the studio or reply to this email to book an

<p>Most piercings take 6-12 months to fully heal, so patience is key! You're doing great.</p>
