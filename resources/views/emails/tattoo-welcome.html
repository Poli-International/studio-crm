<p>Hi {{CLIENT_NAME}},</p>

<p>Thank you for trusting us with your new tattoo! It was a pleasure having you in the studio today.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate Aftercare Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the bandage on for 2-4 hours (or as directed by your artist).</li>
    <li>Wash gently with warm water and fragrance-free soap.</li>
    <li>Pat dry with a clean paper towel. Do not rub.</li>
    <li>Apply a very thin layer of ointment (like Aquaphor) if recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll check in with you in a couple of days to make sure everything is healing perfectly.</p>

<p>If you have any urgent concerns, reply to this email.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>The {{STUDIO_NAME}} Team</p>
