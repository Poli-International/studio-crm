<p>Hi {{CLIENT_NAME}},</p>

<p>Your tattoo has been healing for one week now! Let's make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1 Aftercare Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Your tattoo should be peeling or flaking (this is normal!)</li>
    <li>Continue washing gently 2-3 times daily with fragrance-free soap</li>
    <li>Apply unscented lotion when it feels dry or tight</li>
    <li>Avoid scratching or picking at flakes - let them fall off naturally</li>

</ul>
