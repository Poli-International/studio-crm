<p>Hi {{CLIENT_NAME}},</p>

<p>Wow, it's been 6 months since your tattoo with {{ARTIST_NAME}}! We hope you're loving it.</p>

<p>Most tattoos are fully settled by now. Sometimes, lines might need a tiny refresh or colors a little boost to keep
    them looking perfect for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Do you need a touch-up?</strong></p>
<p>If you see any light spots or gaps, we'd love to fix them up for you. Touch-ups are often free or discounted within
    the first year.</p>

<p>Hope to see you soon!</p>
